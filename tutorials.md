Basic Tutorial
================
This tutorial will walk you through creating a gel file and some basic network files from scratch. All you will need is a downloaded version of Mango.

Open **Mango** and go to **File/New** or hit **Ctrl+N** to create a gel script. Create a new folder on your Desktop called **Basic** and name the new gel script "gel.txt".

A new file should show up in the editor pane with a tab labeled "gel.txt".
