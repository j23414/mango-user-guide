Basics Walk-Through Tutorial
================
This tutorial will walk you through creating a gel file and some basic network files from scratch. All you will need is a downloaded version of Mango.

Open **Mango** and go to **File/New** or hit **Ctrl+N** to create a gel script. Create a new folder on your Desktop called **Basic** and name the new gel script "gel.txt".

A new file should show up in the editor pane with a tab labeled "gel.txt". Type the following four lines into the gel.txt. 

```
int i=1;
float f=2.2;
double d=3.3;
string s="Hello World";
```

These are the four basic data types in Gel. 

When you start editing gel.txt, an \* symbol appears next the to the name in the tab. This means you have unsaved changes. Hit **Ctrl+S** to save file and notice how the \* goes away.

Click inside of the gel.txt and place the cursor on the first line. Then press **Ctrl+Enter**
