## Installing Mango

Mango is a stand-alone C++ application and installers can be downloaded for Windows, Mac, and Linux. **You DO NOT have to compile anything.** 

In January 2014, Hui-Hsien Chou and [Jennifer Chang](https://github.com/j23414) started developing Mango, the graph exploration system, while at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu). Since August 2016, Mango has been licensed and trademarked as "Mango Graph Studio" for continued development to [Complex Computation, LLC](https://www.complexcomputation.com/en). A community version of Mango is freely available and a paid commercial version of Mango is in development.

## First time running Mango Graph Studio 

### Running Mango Graph Studio on Mac Versions

The security settings on Mac may require you to first right click on the application and then select run. It will give you a warning that Mango Graph Studio does not have a apple developer certificate. Click on **Open** anyway and the application will run. 

If you only left click on Mango Graph Studio, the same warning will pop up but without an **Open** button. 

### Version Updates

Mango Graph Studio is under active development so it is important to check for updates regularly. 

1. Open Mango Graph Studio
2. On the menu bar, open **Help/Check for updates...**
3. You will need to be connected to the internet. If a new version of Mango is available, a message box will pop up:

4. Install a new version by repeating the steps of installation above. 

### Customizing the user interface

**Font Size**

You can increase the font size for the console and the editor using Ctrl++ on Windows and Linux or Cmd++ on Mac. Use Ctrl+= or Cmd+- to decrease font. 

Note that the code font will increase while the text in the data panel and the graph canvas will remain the same. This will not increase the font size of node or link labels.

**Panel Layout**

Click and drag headers of Editor and Console if you want to rearrange the panes on the screen.
