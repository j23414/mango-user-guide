Yet another learning curve...
=======

This book introduces a new environment for integrating, exploring and analyzing heterogeneous networks. I wrote this book for anyone who wants to start exploring and combining network files. We started developing Mango (manual analysis of networks and gene ontology) in early summer of 2014. The project combined several layers of implementation to form the system.

Code blocks look good: 

```
node(string name) nt;
link[float weight] lt;
graph(nt,lt) g={("A")[]("B")[]("C")};
```

I need to figure out how to add equations

\$\frac{1}{2}\$
