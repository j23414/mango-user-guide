Why learn Mango?
=======

This book introduces Mango, an environment for integrating, exploring and analyzing heterogeneous networks. Mango development started in Summer of 2014 as a response to a need for scale-able, flexible methods of integrating massive networks. 

## It's Complicated...

Complex means "composed of many different parts". What word better describes the state of data analysis today? From open  digital repositories to self reported personal information, businesses and individual analysts have access to a treasure trove of information. But converting this seemingly endless supply of data into practical applications continues to be a monolithic and many-headed beast.

The analysis of data is defined as the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making.  This explosion of publicly available data means anyone can become a professional analyst. The major hurdle is limited time. Analysts often go through a multi-step process to download, clean, integrate, and analyze data. The majority of time seems to be spent logically organizing the data instead of exploring. We hoped to develop a tool that enabled data analysts to interact with the data in a way that is effective, fast, and doesn't make you want to pull your hair out.

Mango grew out of the belief that complex does not have to mean difficult and hard to work with. Using basic principles, complexity can be managed, integrated, and interpreted. We wanted to bring the excitement and joy back to data exploration. We wanted to make serendipitous discoveries achievable for the masses. We honestly believe Mango does this and this book will introduce you, the reader, to the playground of network analysis.
