Strings
---
Strings are any type of text that contain letters, numbers and symbols. For example "c", "4 sale", and "Hello World"; Strings are defined using the keyword **string** and the variable name.

```
string s = "hello world";
string name = "Bob";
```

Strings must be surrounded by double quotation marks. Gel does not recognize single quotes. 

```
/* will not work */
string s = 'hello world';

/* will work */
string s = "hello world";
```
