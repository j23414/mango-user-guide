# It's Complicated

Complex means "composed of many different parts". What word better describes the state of data analysis today? From open  digital repositories to self reported personal information, businesses and individual analysts have access to a treasure trove of data. But converting this seemingly endless supply of information into practical applications continues to be a monolithic and many-headed beast.

The analysis of data is defined as the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making.  This explosion of publicly available data means anyone can become a professional analyst. The major hurdle is time, time to download, time to clean, and time to analyze data. Time to mull and ask questions, exploring all possible avenues. Time to find a method to interact with the data in a way that is effective, fast, and just plain enjoyable. ("doesn't make you want to pull your hair out")

Mango grew out of the belief that complex does not have to mean difficult and hard to work with. Using basic principles, complexity can be managed, integrated, and interpreted. We wanted to bring the excitement and joy back to data exploration. We wanted to make serendipitous discoveries achievable for the masses. We honestly believe Mango does this and this book will introduce you, the reader, to the playground of network analysis. 
## The data, aka "drinking from a fire hydrant"

There is no limit to the amount of data available online in this day and age. But here is a listing of what data sets are available to get you started. For network analysis, many would be familiar with SNAP or the Standford Large Network Data Set Collection. (https://snap.stanford.edu/data) From their homepage, they contain publicly available social networks, networks with ground-truth communities, communication networks, citation networks, collaboration networks, web graphs, amazon networks, internet networks, road networks, autonomous systems, signed networks, wikipedia networks, twitter and other online communities.
