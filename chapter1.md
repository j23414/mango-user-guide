## The data, aka "drinking from a fire hydrant"

There is no limit to the amount of data available online in this day and age. But here is a listing of what data sets are available to get you started. For network analysis, many would be familiar with SNAP or the Standford Large Network Data Set Collection. (https://snap.stanford.edu/data) From their homepage, they contain publicly available social networks, networks with ground-truth communities, communication networks, citation networks, collaboration networks, web graphs, amazon networks, internet networks, road networks, autonomous systems, signed networks, wikipedia networks, twitter and other online communities.
